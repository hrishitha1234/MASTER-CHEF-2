PINEAPPPLE CAKE

# Ingredients:
 1.1 cup Crushed Canned Pineapple
 2.1½ cups All purpose flour
 3.1 teaspoon Baking powder
 4.½ teaspoon Baking Soda
 5.¼ teaspoon Salt
 6.½ cup Vegetable or Canola Oil
 7.½ cup Sugar
 8.½ cup Condensed Milk

# PREPARATION

MAKING OF EGGLESS PINEAPPLE CAKE:
1.Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 8″ round cake pan. Make sure that the cake pan is at least 2″ deep. Line the pan with parchment paper and lightly grease it. Drain the crushed pineapple and reserve the liquid.
2.Combine all the dry ingredients in a small bowl.
3.Whisk wet ingredients in a large bowl until well combined. Add the dry ingredients along with some of the crushed pineapple pieces. Mix well. pour into the prepared pan and bake until done.
4.Once the cake is baked. Remove onto a wire rack to cool completely.

# MAKING OF WHIPPED CREAM FROSTING:
1.Combine heavy cream, confectioners sugar, stabilizer and vanilla in a medium size bowl and beat until soft peaks form.

# DECORATION AND ICING OF THE CAKE:
1.Once the cake is completely cooled, use a sharp serrated knife and slice the cake in half horizontally. Do your best to cut the cake evenly. But don’t stress too much. Once the pineapple pastry is assembled, it will all be just fine.
2.If desired, remove the darker crust on the top, sides and bottom of the cake. This helps the cake to absorb the pineapple juice that is brushed on later.
3.Place the bottom half of the cake on a serving plate. Brush the cake liberally with reserved pineapple juice.
4.Add a dollop of the whipped icing and using a offset spatula or a spreading knife, spread it evenly over the cake.
5.Then sprinkle half of the pineapple chunks evenly over the cake.
6.Carefully place the other half of the cake on top. Brush this layer with pineapple juice.
7.Frost the entire cake with the rest of the icing. Use your creativity to decorate the cake. Refrigerate for at least 1~2 hours before cutting and serving.
